## Pet Adoption Platform
This repository contains the code for a comprehensive Pet Adoption Platform designed to streamline the adoption process
by matching pets with potential adopters using a machine-learning model. Users can browse pets, view details and see adoption likelihood, while shelters can manage listings and connect with adopters. The platform also supports community engagement through events and donations.

We can design a web application with both staff and admin interfaces to create an interface for pet adoption platform with the mentioned features. 
## Features

- **Adoption Likelihood Prediction Model:**
  Utilizes a Random Forest machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a pet being adopted based on features like weight, breed, health, etc.

- **Separate Access for Admin and Normal Users:**
  Distinct access levels for administrative functions and regular user activities.

- **Reports and Analytics:**
  - Generates visualizations (charts) to analyze the relationship between various features and adoption likelihood for admin access.
  - Offers insights into trends, management, and potential issues within the adoption process.

- **Pet Management:**
  Admins can add, update, and delete pet listings.

- **Shelter Management:**
  Admins can add and update shelter information.

  - Enables users to register for and participate in events and campaigns organized by shelters.
  - Provides functionality for users to donate to shelters and adoption centers.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  Allows users to browse pets and view details, including adoption likelihood.

- **Community Engagement Features:**
  Supports community involvement through events and donation options.
